    <h1>Fleeting Moments</h1>
    <p>Please choose a version, then upload 4 files (preferably JPEG):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="v0/index.html">Version 0</a>
        <ul>
          <li>First draft using p5.js to create a 2x2 grid where the image is split into 4 chunks that are randomly swapped between the images, while gradually scaling down and blurring the grid to create a greater sense of the images merging into each other.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="v1/index.html">Version 1</a>
        <ul>
          <li>Scaling the grid down created too much empty space, so i decided to keep the grid the original size and instead rotate the grid around the X and Y axis based on the cursor position to  make it feel more engaging/interactive.</li>
          <li>Added some automatic movement around Z axis to make it feel less static.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="v2/index.html">Version 2 (UPLOAD BUTTON IS LOCATED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN)</a>
        <ul>
          <li>Significantly reduced cursor-based rotation of the grid.</li>
          <li>Images split into 16 chunks so that they look more like pixels.</li>
          <li>Switched to a dark mode color scheme.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="v3/index.html">Version 3</a>
        <ul>
          <li>Added logo's to establish a dark and futuristic tone.</li>
          <li>Created a CRT screen texture over the grid to simulate a screen, emphasizing that what is shown in the grid happens on a device.</li>
          <li>Included the option to download the current grid as a JPEG file, making the experience feel more meaningful and permanent.</li>
          <li>Added metadata and description on the right side of the screen to complete the layout.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
